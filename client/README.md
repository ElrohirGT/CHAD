<h1 align="center">GUI Client</h1>

**IMPORTANT!:** The GUI uses Qt for graphic rendering, it can be installed in various forms like [Qt Online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-dev), or your package manager if you are in linux.

## Getting started üöÄ


For the client we use [cmake](https://cmake.org/) to compile the client and the UI. All you need to do is create the build directory

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

In this directory is where the client is compiled and executable file is generated

**IMPORTANT:** All compilation and execution commans should be done in this `build/` folder.

## Building the project üë∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


To build the project follow the nexts steps:

```bash
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
Also instead of using `cmake --build .`, you can use the following command:

```bash
make
```

## Running the project üèÉ

With the project built, you can start the GUI with the command:

```bash
# Be sure you are in the build directory or specify it in the command when runnung the project
./chad_ui <username> <connection url>
# Example
./chad_ui chad ws://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Multithreading üßµ

The multithreading in the app works somehow like the Lambdas on AWS, or Azure Function in microsoft. **Threads are created and deleted on demand**.

### Why?
A client, unlike a server, doesn't need to be highly available for incoming messages. In practice, especially for personal chats, it's quite rare to receive messages from multiple contacts at the same time ‚Äî sometimes, you might not hear from someone for months! **Creating an active thread per contact would waste a lot of resources waiting on chats that are mostly inactive**.

Instead, we chose a design where a slight delay of a few milliseconds is acceptable in exchange for significantly lower resource usage. **Threads are created , recycled and destroyed dynamically based on chat activity**, minimizing idle resources that would otherwise sit waiting for incoming messages.

### How it works

On startup, two threads are created and persist until the application closes:

- **GUI Thread**: Manages the application's window rendering.
- **Controller Thread**: Handles incoming connections from the server and spawns task threads to process them.


In addition to these, a thread pool is maintained to manage the threads responsible for processing incoming messages. When the controller creates a new task, the thread pool checks for available threads. If none are free, it creates a new one and recycles it for future tasks. **Threads are freed after 30 seconds of inactivity to avoid excessive resource consumption**.

**Flow:**

1. The app starts and spawns the UI and Controller threads.
2. A message is received, and the Controller spawns a thread to process it.
3. Once the task is completed, the task thread notifies the Controller.
4. The Controller notifies the UI that the Global State has changed, triggering a UI render.

### Yeah yeah, but how does it look in the code

#### Global State
Stores the state of the entire app.

https://github.com/ElrohirGT/CHAD/blob/2c12466a235f8979baee4a4da5ec458b4bdfc2ba/client/client.cpp#L167-L185C1

#### Controller Thread
We are using Qt Thread library, they represent a thread as a class.

https://github.com/ElrohirGT/CHAD/blob/2c12466a235f8979baee4a4da5ec458b4bdfc2ba/client/client.cpp#L596-L606

This is how a message is assigned to a Message Task thread:

https://github.com/ElrohirGT/CHAD/blob/2c12466a235f8979baee4a4da5ec458b4bdfc2ba/client/client.cpp#L644-L666

#### Message Task
Represents a worker which process a single message. The syncronization occurs bye a Mutex at the beginning of thread execution.

https://github.com/ElrohirGT/CHAD/blob/2c12466a235f8979baee4a4da5ec458b4bdfc2ba/client/client.cpp#L299-L313

#### UI handlers

If the UI wants to request something to de server it does so by a function.
